# MathQuest
MathQuest is a group project that was written in my Software Engineering class at Westminster College.  This project is written in Java and takes advantage of object-oriented programming.  It has several classes that extend others, and has an abstract class as well.  It also features a fully functioning GUI.  
The idea behind this game was to teach young children math.  We decided to make an RPG, where an adventurer goes out into the world seeking treasures and wonderful experiences.  You can collect items and gear.  You can rest in the inn, and purchase things in the blacksmith.  And you can fight mercilessly against a seemingly innumerable onslaught of monsters to level up and attempt to conquer the legendary Universe Dragon!
I had some pretty wonderful group mates for this project.  Each of us worked on a different aspect of the game and it was really cool to see each personâ€™s strengths come through.  Some were adept at coding, others were great at concepts and visualizing the design, and even others were great at listening and conveying the process on paper.
